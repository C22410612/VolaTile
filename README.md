# VolaTile

### Description

VolaTile is a fast paced, multi-tasking onslaught where you'll be controlling between 1 - 9 seperate and uniquely different smaller games at the same time

The catch, while you're focused on one of your games the others will be slowed to a twentieth of its speed to give you time to micro manage each individual game you have up

Put your micro-managing skills to the test as you try to stay alive with each game effecting each other with powerups and a currency system
with danger creeping in from all sides

Currently 3 games are functional :
- A reverse bullet hell where the player has enemies approaching from all sides as he fends them off upgrading his abilites and stats along the way

- A laser dodging game similar to [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga) where your aim is to survive as long as possible amist a huge volume projectiles aimed your way

- A tower defense where ramping waves of enemies slowly attempt to overwhelm you as you build towers with currency you've collected from other games. Watch them slowly creep to the end as you try to grab any currency you can in other games to build a strong enough defence


### Future plans

While there will only have a maximum of 9 games running at any one time the plan is to have well over 15 possible games to keep the gameplay loop fresh and interesting aswell as to allow for more interesting and unique experiances upon multiple runs

More original music will be added for differnt stages of the game while keeping the current track as a main menu / pause theme

Original 2D pixel sprites, background art, GUI components and animations

Eventually a full realease!
